                Peak Streetwear is a brand of urban clothes created by Eric Cartman in 1985, when he realized that
                skaters
                had to constantly buy new clothes, especially shoes. So he designed the first five products thinking
                about
                durability and style. Since then, the only objective of Peak Streetwear was to offer the best option for
                skaters, bikers and all urban athletes, in order to have the possibility to buy less than two or three
                pair
                of shoes per month.
